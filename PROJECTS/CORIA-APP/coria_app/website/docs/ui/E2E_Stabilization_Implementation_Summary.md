# E2E Test Stabilization Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025 23:00
**Implementation**: Playwright Timeout + Production E2E Stabilization
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for validation

---

## üéØ Implementation Goals

**Primary Objective**: Resolve E2E test timeout issues preventing successful test execution

**Specific Requirements**:
1. Increase Playwright test timeout from 60s to 120s
2. Configure navigation timeout for i18n route rendering (30s)
3. Reduce workers to 2 for consistent behavior
4. Standardize production build testing workflow
5. Document CI/CD workflow integration

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Playwright Configuration Update

**File**: [playwright.config.ts](../../playwright.config.ts)

**Changes Applied**:

```typescript
// Line 8: Worker Configuration
workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 2, // Reduced from 4 to 2 locally

// Line 9: Test Timeout
timeout: 120000, // Increased from 60000ms (60s ‚Üí 120s)

// Line 25: Navigation Timeout
navigationTimeout: 30000, // Increased from 20000ms (20s ‚Üí 30s)
```

**Rationale**:
- **120s test timeout**: Accommodates observed 1.4-2.0 minute page loads for i18n routes
- **30s navigation**: Server-side rendering requires more time than client-side navigation
- **2 workers**: Reduces resource contention, consistent CI/local behavior

### 2. Production E2E Script Validation

**File**: [scripts/run-e2e-prod.sh](../../scripts/run-e2e-prod.sh)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Already exists and properly configured

**Script Capabilities**:
- Automated `BUILD ‚Üí START ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí CLEANUP` lifecycle
- Health check with configurable timeout (60s default)
- PID-based server management for clean cleanup
- BASE_URL standardization (`http://localhost:3000`)
- Error handling for build failures, server crashes, test failures

**Package.json Script**:
```json
"test:e2e:smoke:prod": "./scripts/run-e2e-prod.sh"
```

### 3. CI/CD Workflow Documentation

**File**: [CI_Workflow_Patch_E2E_Smoke.md](./CI_Workflow_Patch_E2E_Smoke.md)

**Contents**:
- Complete patch for `.github/workflows/ci.yml` e2e-smoke job
- Before/after comparison of configuration
- Benefits and rationale for each change
- Testing strategy and rollback plan
- Expected outcomes and monitoring metrics

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Add production build step before E2E tests
2. Replace `npm run test:e2e:smoke` with `npm run test:e2e:smoke:prod`
3. Increase job timeout from 15 to 20 minutes
4. Add trace artifact upload for debugging

### 4. Test Execution Report Update

**File**: [I18N_Test_Execution_Report.md](./I18N_Test_Execution_Report.md)

**Added Section**: "üöÄ Configuration Updates" at top of report

**Contents**:
- Summary of all Playwright config changes
- Production E2E script documentation
- CI/CD workflow integration guidance
- Next steps for validation

| **Navigation Timeout** | 20000ms (20s) | 30000ms (30s) | +50% |
| **Workers (Local)** | 4 | 2 | -50% |
| **Workers (CI)** | 2 | 2 | No change |

---

## üß™ Validation Instructions

### Local Testing

**Step 1**: Verify configuration changes
```bash
cd website
cat playwright.config.ts | grep -E "timeout|workers|navigationTimeout"

# Expected output:
# workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 2,
# timeout: 120000,
# navigationTimeout: 30000,
```

**Step 2**: Run production E2E tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:smoke:prod

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Production build completes (~2-3 min)
# 2. Server starts and health check passes (~30s)
# 3. E2E tests execute with 120s per test
# 4. Tests complete or timeout gracefully
# 5. Server cleanup automatic
```

**Step 3**: Check test results
```bash
npx playwright show-report

# Verify:
# - Tests complete within 120s (not timing out at 60s)
# - Trace artifacts available for debugging
# - Screenshots captured at failure points
```

### CI Integration Testing

**Step 1**: Apply CI workflow patch
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` using recommendations from [CI_Workflow_Patch_E2E_Smoke.md](./CI_Workflow_Patch_E2E_Smoke.md)

**Step 2**: Create feature branch and PR
```bash
git checkout -b feature/e2e-stabilization
git add .
git commit -m "feat(e2e): stabilize tests with 120s timeout and production build"
git push origin feature/e2e-stabilization
```

**Step 3**: Monitor CI execution
- Job duration: Should be 15-18 minutes (build + tests)
- Test results: Target 100% pass rate
- Artifacts: Verify trace files are uploaded

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements

**Before Stabilization**:
- ‚ùå 4/9 tests timed out at 60s
- ‚ùå Dev server compilation delays (1848 modules)
- ‚ùå Unpredictable test duration (1.4-2.0 min per test)
- ‚ùå Missing trace artifacts for debugging

**After Stabilization**:
- ‚úÖ All tests complete within 120s timeout
- ‚úÖ Pre-rendered routes load faster
- ‚úÖ Consistent test performance
- ‚úÖ Full trace artifacts available

### Test Reliability

| Metric | Before | Target After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Pass Rate** | 55% (5/9) | 100% (9/9) | +82% |
| **Timeout Rate** | 44% (4/9) | 0% | -100% |
| **Test Duration** | 1.4-2.0 min | <2 min | Consistent |
| **False Positives** | High (timeouts) | Low | Reduced |

## üîç Root Cause Resolution

### Problem Analysis

**Original Issue**:
> E2E tests timing out at 60s when page loads take 1.4-2.0 minutes

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Development Server Compilation**: 1848 modules compiled on first request (6.7s initial load)
2. **i18n Route Rendering**: Server-side rendering adds overhead for locale switching
3. **Insufficient Timeout**: 60s timeout inadequate for cold start + locale switching
4. **Resource Contention**: 4 parallel workers competing for system resources

### Solutions Applied

1. **Timeout Increase**: 60s ‚Üí 120s provides 2x buffer for observed load times
2. **Production Build**: Pre-rendered routes eliminate compilation delays
3. **Navigation Timeout**: 20s ‚Üí 30s accommodates SSR overhead
4. **Worker Reduction**: 4 ‚Üí 2 reduces contention and improves stability

## üéØ Success Criteria

Implementation considered successful when:

1. ‚úÖ All 9 i18n E2E tests complete within 120s timeout

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

```bash
cd website

# Revert Playwright config
git checkout HEAD~1 playwright.config.ts

# Revert to dev server testing in CI
# Update .github/workflows/ci.yml e2e-smoke job:
- name: Run E2E smoke tests
  run: npm run test:e2e:smoke  # Uses webServer config
```

### Partial Rollback (Keep timeout increase, revert production build)

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
timeout: 120000, // Keep increased timeout
workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 4, // Restore local worker count
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Remove production build step, keep test:e2e:smoke
```

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Key Insights

1. **Dev vs Prod Performance**: Development server has significant compilation overhead not representative of production
2. **Timeout Buffer**: Tests should have 2x expected duration as timeout buffer
3. **Worker Count**: More workers don't always improve performance; 2-4 is optimal sweet spot
4. **Production Testing**: E2E tests should run against production builds for accuracy

### Best Practices Established

1. **Always test with production builds** for performance validation
2. **Set timeouts based on observed behavior**, not assumptions
3. **Reduce workers for stability** when resource contention is suspected
4. **Capture traces by default** for debugging, not just on retries
5. **Document timeout rationale** for future maintenance

---

## üèÅ Conclusion

All planned changes have been successfully implemented and documented. The E2E test stabilization is complete pending validation:

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Next Action**: Run `npm run test:e2e:smoke:prod` to validate configuration

**Expected Result**: All 9 tests complete within 120s, 100% pass rate

**CI Integration**: Ready to apply documented workflow patch

The foundation is now in place for stable, reliable E2E testing with proper timeout configuration and production-accurate test environment.
