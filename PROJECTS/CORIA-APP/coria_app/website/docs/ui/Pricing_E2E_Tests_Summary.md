- `verifyConsistentCurrency(symbol)` - All prices use same currency
- `verifyTableAccessibility()` - Check ARIA/scope attributes
- `verifyPaywallTrigger(trigger)` - Validate upgrade prompts

## Test Coverage Breakdown

### 1. Pricing Upgrade Flows (7 tests)

**✅ Page Loading**

## Known Test Considerations

### 1. Paywall Trigger Components

The current test implementation checks for paywall **messaging** in the feature comparison table (e.g., "alternatives", "AI limit", "pantry 20 products").

Full paywall **UI components** (modal prompts, inline cards) would require:
- User interaction to trigger (e.g., clicking "alternatives" when not Premium)
- Mock authentication state (Free vs Premium user)
- Navigation to specific feature flows

**Enhancement Opportunity:**
- Add authenticated user fixtures
- Create scenarios triggering each paywall
- Verify modal/card UI rendering
- Test CTA button clicks lead to upgrade flow

### 2. Currency Formatting

Tests verify currency **symbols** appear ($/€/₺) but don't validate exact Intl.NumberFormat output due to:
- Browser locale settings affecting format
- Different decimal/thousand separators by region
- Locale-specific number formatting rules

**Current Approach:**
- Verify symbol presence
- Check price numbers appear
- Validate consistency (all prices use same symbol)

### 3. Dynamic Content

Some elements use flexible locators due to:
- i18n key variations across locales
- Component structure differences
- CSS class variations

**Locator Strategy:**
- Multiple selector fallbacks (data-testid → text → class)
- Contains text matching (case-insensitive)
- Ancestor navigation for context

### 4. Visual Regression

Screenshots are captured for **manual review**. Automated pixel-diff comparison would require:
- Baseline images for each locale
- Percy/Applitools integration
- Threshold configuration for acceptable differences

**Current Approach:**
- Capture screenshots during test run
- Manual review for visual anomalies
- Smoke test for visibility (not pixel-perfect)

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration

Add to `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run Pricing E2E Tests
  run: npx playwright test pricing-upgrade.spec.ts --project=chromium

- name: Upload Pricing Screenshots
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: pricing-screenshots
    path: test-results/screenshots/pricing-*

- name: Upload Test Results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: pricing-test-results
    path: |
      test-results/results.json
      test-results/junit.xml
```

### Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Execution Times:**
- Upgrade Flows: ~30-40s (7 tests)
- Regional Pricing: ~60-90s (11 tests, multiple region switches)
- Discount Badges: ~30-40s (6 tests)
- Accessibility: ~40-50s (9 tests, DOM queries)
- User Interactions: ~25-35s (5 tests)
- Cross-Locale: ~60-80s (5 tests, 4 locales)
- Visual Regression: ~50-60s (8 screenshots)

**Total Suite**: ~5-7 minutes

### Parallelization

Tests can run in parallel with proper configuration:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  fullyParallel: true,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : 4,
  // ...
});
```

**Parallel Execution:**
- 4 workers local: ~2-3 minutes
- 2 workers CI: ~4-5 minutes

## Next Steps
