   - Budget checks: requested ‚â§ total budget
   - Timeline validation: end date > start date

- Technical: IP address (hashed), submission timestamp

**Legal Basis:** Legitimate interest (evaluation of funding applications)

- External Auditors: As required by law

### Applicant Rights

Applicants have the right to:

1. **Access**: Request copy of their application data
2. **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate information
3. **Erasure**: Request deletion (exceptions: funded projects, legal obligations)
4. **Portability**: Receive data in machine-readable format
5. **Objection**: Object to processing (will result in application rejection)

**Response Timeline:** 30 days from request

### Data Breach Protocol

If application data is compromised:

1. **Within 4 hours**: Assess breach scope and impact
2. **Within 24 hours**: Notify Data Protection Officer
3. **Within 72 hours**: Report to supervisory authority if high risk

## üîß System Administration

### Audit Log Maintenance

**Location:** `/audit-logs/foundation-applications.jsonl`

**Format:** JSON Lines (JSONL) - one JSON object per line

**Retention:** 24 months, then automatic cleanup via cron job

**Manual Cleanup** (if needed):
```bash
cd /path/to/audit-logs
node cleanup-old-logs.js --older-than=24months --dry-run  # Preview
node cleanup-old-logs.js --older-than=24months  # Execute
```

### Email Delivery Monitoring

**Check for failed deliveries:**
```bash
# Check email service logs
pm2 logs email-service --lines 100 | grep "FAILED"

# Check SMTP server logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log | grep "foundation@coria.app"
```

**Common Issues:**
- **Bounced Emails**: Invalid email address - verify and request correction
- **Spam Folder**: Ask applicant to whitelist `foundation@coria.app`
- **SMTP Timeout**: Check network connectivity and SMTP credentials

### Rate Limiting Adjustments

If legitimate users are being rate-limited:

1. **Check Current Limits:**
   ```bash
   echo "REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE: 5"
   echo "REQUESTS_PER_DAY: 50"
   echo "BLOCK_DURATION: 900 seconds (15 min)"
   ```

2. **Whitelist Specific IP** (emergency only):
   ```bash
   # Add to .env
   RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST=1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8
   ```

3. **Temporarily Increase Limits** (requires code change + deploy):
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/security/rate-limiter.ts
   const REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 10;  // Was 5
   const REQUESTS_PER_DAY = 100;     // Was 50
   ```

## üìä Reporting & Analytics

### Weekly Operations Report

**Every Monday**, generate and review:

```sql
-- Application volume (last 7 days)

  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(*) as applications,

  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'submitted' THEN 1 END) as legitimate
FROM audit_log
WHERE timestamp >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp);

-- Category breakdown
SELECT
  category,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(budgetRequested) as avg_budget
FROM audit_log
WHERE timestamp >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
